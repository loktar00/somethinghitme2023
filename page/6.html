                                         Finally sat down this weekend and completed my Javascript Lunar Lander clone, JSLander. Decided to make it after messing around with midpoint displacement towards the end of last year. The development of JSLander overall wasn't too bad, the trickiest thing was making everything work exactly the same when you were zoomed in...

                                        Been messing with canvas again, and put together a little demo that creates procedural cell looking textures, based off of the Worley algorithm. You can achieve some pretty amazing results, also added the option to animate, but since the algorithm has not been optimized yet you have to keep the dimensions and number of points low...

At first I was pretty skeptical, the concept is so simple.. until I found myself spending hours recreating Mario...

Added a few new things to the Jquery snowfall plugin, you now have the ability to clear the snow from elements..

                                        When I sit down to prototype something new I always find myself looking up the same snippets to do the same types of things. I figured I might as well record them somewhere so I know an easy place to look when I do forget. All the samples will be in Javascript and should be able to be easily converted to any other language...
