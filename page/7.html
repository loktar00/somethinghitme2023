                                    <p class="article-synopsis">
                                        The idea of creating height maps with JS and canvas came from an idea I started for a different website I'm developing. This small project has taught me many things (some of the unfortunate things I learned is I still suck at math, and I have many JS skills to brush up on). I just couldn't bring myself to give it up so I also implemented a very slow very light voxel engine...
