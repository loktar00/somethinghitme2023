                                        I've been trying to do regular programming exercises lately just to stay sharp and recently I decided to take on sorting algorithms. I used my current language of choice (javascript) and set out to implement the quick sort algorithm. Below is the portion of my code that completes this...

Heres a quick look at one of the random games I'm making using JavaScript and the Canvas element. Its essentially a clone of Lunar Lander. As it is right now you can't actually crash, and if you successfully land on one of the pads, your drops from the top again...

                                        The idea of creating height maps with JS and canvas came from an idea I started for a different website I'm developing. This small project has taught me many things (some of the unfortunate things I learned is I still suck at math, and I have many JS skills to brush up on). I just couldn't bring myself to give it up so I also implemented a very slow very light voxel engine...
