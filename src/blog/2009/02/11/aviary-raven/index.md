[This site](http://aviary.com/) is awesome. I found this a while back when they created [Phoenix](http://aviary.com/dashboard# "Phoenix") basically an online photoshop. Today I was on Digg and I found an article related to [Raven](http://aviary.com/dashboard# "Raven") its a fantastic application very similar to Adobe Illustrator. The great thing (besides the fact that I can access it anywhere in the world) is that its totally cross browser even supporting IE6, which unfortunately I am currently married to it at my job....

Anyway if you don't have the $650+ to throw down on any of the Adobe products these products from Aviary are a great alternative, and I will be using them pretty often in the near future.
