I finally decided to create my own personal blog. I do so many random things throughout the year I figured its a waste to not share my experiences for anyone who may come across or do something similar.

For my first post I'll share a little about myself. I'm 26 with a wife and 4 kids. By day I'm a web developer for the government and by night I'm a web developer / all around developer for myself. I currently run 5 other sites to include,

- [http://www.undeadgames.com](http://www.undeadgames.com)
- [http://www.zombiegames.net](http://www.zombiegames.net)
- [http://www.zombiebooks.com](http://www.zombiebooks.com)
- [http://www.loktar.com](http://www.loktar.com) (I sell software I've made here)
- Site to be named which has not totally gone public yet.

Currently besides this site I'm working on Undeadgames.com its in the redesign stage  and I'm hoping to really get that site going well again.

I'm sure mainly what you'll find here are my favorite development topics and random projects i'm working on.
