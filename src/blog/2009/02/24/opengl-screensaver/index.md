Well I have finished my mess around project with OpenGL. I decided to make a screensaver BIG SURPRISE :)! Its fully functioning, with the media embedded (1 image) but it requires the 2 tao DLL's in order to run. Also I went ahead and included the source. Its no big secret how to create a screensaver in C# but I really didn't see many relating to OpenGL. I have my sprite class implemented but not the emitter class, so the program.cs is a bit sloppy because it handles the particles in there.Â  Only thing its missing is multimonitor support, mainly because I forgot to add that until just now. If any one wants me to I can go ahead and add that to the source.

Overall its very simple in nature and I am going to move up now to something a bit more complex, either a screensaver which uses 3d models, or a simple game like breakout our tetris. Decisions Decisions.
