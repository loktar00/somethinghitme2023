Got bored today and decided to put together a quick snow plugin for Jquery. On my site [Undeadgames.com](http://www.undeadgames.com) the members look forward to the snow every year. I decided to replace the older one we were using, it was nice overall, but ran terribly slow on some browsers, and didn't really care about window dimensions.

[Click to download the plugin](http://www.somethinghitme.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/snowfall.jquery.zip)

The plugin is easy to implement, load up the file and call

`$(document).snowfall();`

or

`$(document).snowfall(number of flakes);`

Overall the plugin is pretty useless, and hearkens back to the days of old. Next update will include snow collecting on specified page elements. You can see it in action on either [zombietweets.com](http://www.zombietweets.com), or [undeadgames.com](http://www.undeadgames.com)
