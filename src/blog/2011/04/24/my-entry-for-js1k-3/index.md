Below is what I ended up settling on for an entry for the JS1k.

My ideas ranged for a rainbow road (similar to the Mario Kart level), to a 3d tombstone that said dysentery, a terrain generator, then a wave generator.

I ended up just combining the last two ideas and came up with below.

<canvas id="terCanvas"></canvas>
<script src="/2011/04/24/my-entry-for-js1k-3/js/tersub.js"></script>

Theres really no terrain generation, its just the y value set to a random height. I just didn't have the room in 1k to fit it in unfortunately.
