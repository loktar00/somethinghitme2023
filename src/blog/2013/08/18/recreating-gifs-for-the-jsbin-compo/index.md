date: "2013-08-19"
teaser: "There's a really interesting [competition the creator of jsbin is running](http://remysharp.com/2013/08/14/jsbin-5th-birthday/). The competition involves recreating some pretty amazing gifs (mostly mathmatical based) using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. I couldn't help but try my hand at a few of the gifs. As of this writing I have successfully (mostly anyway) reproduced four of the images."

Im sure Ill try my hand at a few more before the competition is over. But I might need to take a break after the last one, it was pretty tough.
