**[Newer version available](http://www.somethinghitme.com/2011/10/05/jquery-snowfall-1-5-update-now-with-snow-buildup/)**

Fixed a quick bug in the snowfall script, and added an example usage file in the download. Also implemented the changes suggested by Han Bongers, which allows the snow to ignore padding.
