A while back I posted a link to a Flash game I was working on, it was going to be multiplayer using Nanoba. Unfortunately I gave up on it pretty quickly, I'm not a big fan of Flash and I wanted to learn something totally different, so I decided to try and remake the game using Canvas.

So far development has been going pretty well, the single player implementation in its current state can be seen here [http://www.somethinghitme.com/projects/canvaszom/](http://www.somethinghitme.com/projects/canvaszom/) (please not the images are not free they are actually 2d renders from 3d models i have purchased, the code is under the MIT license). It already has more implemented than the Flash version had. There are quite a few things however left to be done and I will try to make a post with every major milestone and write up how I accomplished it. So far the only thing that is not using JavaScript is the sound. I am using Sound Manager for that, which uses a swf in order to generate the sounds.

AS of right now I have put a halt on development of this particular single player game recently because I am actually working on a multiplayer version that is nearing completion. The next post I make will most likely be releasing that and then I will get back to making this a full fledged game... and I'll most likely not use the bald shirtless men as enemies (they are supposed to be zombies!).
