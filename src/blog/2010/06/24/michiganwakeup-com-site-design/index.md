Just finsihed up another site for a client, [http://www.michiganwakeup.com]( http://www.michiganwakeup.com ) . They were very pleased with it. They asked for a site that was very simple and to the point. I still feel as if there is something missing.. but I ha a 48 hour turn around time for this so the I had to get developing pretty fast on the design. I guess there is always Wake Up Michigan 2011.
