My most recent side project was implementing some Action Script lightning code posted by Rybar over on the Flixel forums. Here is what I came up with [http://www.somethinghitme.com/projects/canvaslightning/](http://www.somethinghitme.com/projects/canvaslightning/). Theres definitely a lot to be desired. Was trying to think of some cool things to do with it. It's a work in progress until a good idea comes to me.
