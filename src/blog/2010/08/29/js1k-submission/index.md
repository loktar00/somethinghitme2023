Theres a javascript 1k competition going on [here](http://js1k.com) the rules are simple make something using only javascript in under 1k. It can be minified, whatever just as long as its 1024 bytes or smaller. [This is what I submitted](http://js1k.com/demo/556) (Caution could cause seizures, and vomiting!). You can only submit one thing which kind of sucks, and after looking at the other demos submitted it makes me want to submit something a bit cooler.  Definitely a lot of talent in the competition, cannot wait to see what the results are. Also many of the authors posted the original source which is very handy for poking around and learning some cool new things.
