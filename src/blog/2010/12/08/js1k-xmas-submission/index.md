Wanted to submit something that was just graphical this time around so I worked on a 3D Christmas Tree for my submission. The hardest thing was trying to pack a 3D engine with depth sorting and lighting into such a small package then of course I had to create the shapes for the tree and star. I got that and was happy but was told by my friends I should include snow.. so back to the drawing board. One thing that really helped was using the trick from the [bouncing beholder demo](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/js1k/) from the first JS1K compo.

If you are running a modern browser (not IE8 or below) then below you should see what my submission ended up being.

Of course how it always goes a few hours before there was a pretty awesome Christmas Tree submitted by Roman Cortes [http://js1k.com/2010-xmas/demo/848](http://js1k.com/2010-xmas/demo/848) lol mine is about 1995, where his is really modern looking.
