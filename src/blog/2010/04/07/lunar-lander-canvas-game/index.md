Working on a lot of things lately but noticed I haven't made a post in quite a while. Heres a quick look at one of the random games I'm making using JavaScript and the Canvas element. Its essentially a clone of [Lunar Lander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(video_game) "Lunar Lander").  As it is right now you can't actually crash, and if you successfully land on one of the pads, your drops from the top again.  I'm not sure yet if I'm going to add the zoom effect when you get close to the landing pads, I think its pretty cool looking as a full page game. I imagine making a bunch of lander automated and having it set as the background to a gaming page.. of course it will only work in modern browsers at this time.
