teaser: "I cleaned up my home-grown canvas game framework and posted it on GitHub as JEST. It is a compact base I use for demos and small games, and the post links the repo plus an early demo."

I've been coming up with small games and demos using canvas for a couple of years now, and over that time I've created a framework for doing so. You can see examples in some of my earlier blog posts such as the SOPA game, and the SHMUP thats been in development for a while. Today I decided to pretty some of it up a bit and post it on github. Minified it comes in at only 31k, and provides quite a bit of functionality (I am biased though).

[Here is a link to the github repo](https://github.com/loktar00/jest) and the [first of many demo's Ill be posting](http://loktar00.github.com/jest/).
