So I have been really into wave sims lately. It all started with an excellent tutorial posted [here](http://gamedev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/implementation/make-a-splash-with-2d-water-effects/). I tried my hand at a JS one first using canvas which turned out pretty awesome.

Then I tried something else a bit crazy and decided to do the same thing with only html/css. It turned out pretty cool, not as interactive as the JS one but the effect is still nice. I could see this being used on the bottom of a website.
