                                        Well I got a Kindle 3 for my birthday today, I had one last year for a little bit but had to give it back to work, since then I've found myself wanting another. First thing I tried (besides a web IRC) were some of my canvas demos on the experimental browser that ships with the Kindle. They all seemed to work, just VERY slowly...

                                        Was a bit sick of the older design, it had some weird issues plus honestly I really began to hate it. I am liking this one a lot more, kept the whole light bulb concept from the old design, but other than that pretty much everything else is different. Wanted to incorporate text shadows too, I think they look slick in modern browsers...

                                        Just finished up a new plugin for jQuery. I wanted some breadcrumbs for some pages but wanted to do it all client side, so I came up with jCrumb. jCrumb saves the link and title of the most recent page and adds it to a session cookie, creating a dynamic bread crumb navigation bar on the page. It uses jQuery...

                                         Finally sat down this weekend and completed my Javascript Lunar Lander clone, JSLander. Decided to make it after messing around with midpoint displacement towards the end of last year. The development of JSLander overall wasn't too bad, the trickiest thing was making everything work exactly the same when you were zoomed in...

                                        Been messing with canvas again, and put together a little demo that creates procedural cell looking textures, based off of the Worley algorithm. You can achieve some pretty amazing results, also added the option to animate, but since the algorithm has not been optimized yet you have to keep the dimensions and number of points low...

                                        Game is still coming along, it now supports zooming, which was actually a little bit tricky to figure out. Only a few more things left to add before its a full fledged game.. or clone of a game that is. Check out the progress of JSLander. Now supported in any browser that supports the canvas element...

                                        Im currently working on a web based calendar and I needed to sort my event object by date real quick. So the first thing I did was a quick search on sorting an object by date time. Google becomes such second nature I immediately think of doing that first sometimes before fleshing out a whole solution in my mind...

Heres a quick look at one of the random games I'm making using JavaScript and the Canvas element. Its essentially a clone of Lunar Lander. As it is right now you can't actually crash, and if you successfully land on one of the pads, your drops from the top again...

                                        Been working on the single player canvas game this week and got a few cool things accomplished in terms of performance. The main thing I was working on was trying to reduce the slowdown on real time image rotation. What I ended up coming up with was creating rotated sprite sheets on the fly in memory...

Unfortunately I gave up on it pretty quickly, I'm not a big fan of Flash and I wanted to learn something totally different, so I decided to try and remake the game using Canvas...

                                        The idea of creating height maps with JS and canvas came from an idea I started for a different website I'm developing. This small project has taught me many things (some of the unfortunate things I learned is I still suck at math, and I have many JS skills to brush up on). I just couldn't bring myself to give it up so I also implemented a very slow very light voxel engine...

                                        I've been hearing things about this canvas element lately and I found some really cool uses. Mostly I found examples of charts that use it, which makes sense because in some browsers its not very fast rendering real time elements onto it, and IE browsers do not natively support it. After doing some more research and seeing as its in the HTML 5 specification I figured I would try my hand at making something quick with it...

I made a game about a year ago called Glow Roids (the name is pretty comical when you think about it) using CsGL. I had a bunch of problems with it on different machines, mostly involving ATI cards, and Vista...

It's a pretty big Flash portal similar to Kongregate, the main difference is they offer a multiplayer API. The API is great, its pretty easy to use, and if you've ever done anything with socket programming and sending messages back and forth you'll find no trouble using it at all.
