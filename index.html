                                    Discover a solution for integrating jQuery UI icons with the datepicker plugin. Utilize the showOn and next functions to create a fully themed calendar button without relying on an input field. Simplify the implementation of date pickers and enhance the visual appeal of your user interface.

                                    Well I got a Kindle 3 for my birthday today, I had one last year for a little bit but had to give it back to work, since then I've found myself wanting another. First thing I tried (besides a web IRC) were some of my canvas demos on the experimental browser that ships with the Kindle. They all seemed to work, just VERY slowly...

                                    Was a bit sick of the older design, it had some weird issues plus honestly I really began to hate it. I am liking this one a lot more, kept the whole light bulb concept from the old design, but other than that pretty much everything else is different. Wanted to incorporate text shadows too, I think they look slick in modern browsers...

                                    Just finished up a new plugin for jQuery. I wanted some breadcrumbs for some pages but wanted to do it all client side, so I came up with jCrumb. jCrumb saves the link and title of the most recent page and adds it to a session cookie, creating a dynamic bread crumb navigation bar on the page. It uses jQuery...

I haven't really ever had to do something like this so I figured I would see if it was as easy as I assumed it would be in JS...

                                     Finally sat down this weekend and completed my Javascript Lunar Lander clone, JSLander. Decided to make it after messing around with midpoint displacement towards the end of last year. The development of JSLander overall wasn't too bad, the trickiest thing was making everything work exactly the same when you were zoomed in...

You can achieve some pretty amazing results, also added the option to animate, but since the algorithm has not been optimized yet you have to keep the dimensions and number of points low...

                                    The idea of creating height maps with JS and canvas came from an idea I started for a different website I'm developing. This small project has taught me many things (some of the unfortunate things I learned is I still suck at math, and I have many JS skills to brush up on). I just couldn't bring myself to give it up so I also implemented a very slow very light voxel engine...

                                    I've been hearing things about this canvas element lately and I found some really cool uses. Mostly I found examples of charts that use it, which makes sense because in some browsers its not very fast rendering real time elements onto it, and IE browsers do not natively support it. After doing some more research and seeing as its in the HTML 5 specification I figured I would try my hand at making something quick with it...

                                    Wasn't in the mood this weekend to work on my current flash project, or any other web projects, so I decided to mess around with the TAO framework. I made a game about a year ago called Glow Roids (the name is pretty comical when you think about it) using CsGL. I had a bunch of problems with it on different machines, mostly involving ATI cards, and Vista...

                                    Nonoba if you haven't heard of this site your missing out. It's a pretty big Flash portal similar to Kongregate, the main difference is they offer a multiplayer API. The API is great, its pretty easy to use, and if you've ever done anything with socket programming and sending messages back and forth you'll find no trouble using it at all.

                                    This site is awesome. I found this a while back when they created Phoenix, basically an online Photoshop. Today I was on Digg and I found an article related to Raven. It's a fantastic application very similar to Adobe Illustrator. The great thing (besides the fact that I can access it anywhere in the world) is that it's totally cross-browser, even
